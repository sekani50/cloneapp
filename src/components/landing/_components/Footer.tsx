              In 2004, James Whelan founded The JRWA from his office at home
              with a vision to build a media empire. In the years since, the
              company has continued to grow steadily in our sales, traffic,
              media and internal support departments. Our staff has well over a
              century of combined global marketing experience and we are always
              surrounding ourselves with those who can help our marketing IQ
              grow.{" "}
